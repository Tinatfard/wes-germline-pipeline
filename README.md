# wes-germline-pipeline
This repository contains a small Snakemake workflow for germline variant calling from whole-exome sequencing (WES) data.  
I use it as a simple, modular example of a WES pipeline built around common tools (BWA, Samtools, GATK, FastQC).

## Status

This is an initial version focused on single-sample WES data.  
Planned next steps: add duplicate marking, BQSR, and basic annotation.
